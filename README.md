Moveo Task - 

The task took me about 14 hours.

Please refresh the page to see the differences between Desktop and Mobile style.

Description:
Front-end was developed with Vue, Vuex and Quasar
The DB is NoSQL - Firestore.

There is 9 pads with 2 states, on and off you could
changed them by clicking on the pads.

When a pad is turned on, it start playing its loop only when 
the last pad(that was clicked) is starting playing again.
At the end the loops starting together at the same point.

Theres also play and stop buttons that control the loop , 
and volume button that control the volume.

Bonus:
There is a record button, you could start recording/stop recording
by clicking.
When you have finished recording, a button will appear that allow
you to play your record.
if you want to delete your record , there a button for that.
